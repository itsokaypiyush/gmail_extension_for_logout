ðŸš¨ Auto-Logout for Gmail Based on User Inactivity ðŸ”’

As part of my cybersecurity project SafeLabs, I developed a system that automatically logs out the user from Gmail if there's no keyboard or mouse activity for over 2 minutes helping prevent unauthorized access in sensitive environments like shared labs or public machines.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

Python â€“ Core logic for monitoring user activity and triggering actions

pynput â€“ To detect real-time keyboard and mouse input

time & threading â€“ For efficient idle time tracking

Selenium â€“ Automates Gmail logout by simulating browser actions

Colab (for model training) â†’ Integrated into a local Python environment for system-level interaction

âœ¨ This feature complements the ML-based phishing detection I'm building â€” together forming a compact, intelligent security toolkit aimed at safer web usage 
this project is still in progress
